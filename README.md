# Router Hijack

Hiiii Jack!

## Building
```sh
npm install
npm run build:prod
```

Produces a minified `bundle.min.js` in ./build.

### Watching (for development)
```
npm run watch
```

Makes webpack watch the filesystem and rebuild whenever changes are
made. This allows allows webpack to do in-memory caching,
resulting in much faster builds.
